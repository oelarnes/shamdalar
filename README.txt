Shamdalar is a fully implemented rules engine for Magic: the Gathering. It is by far
my most extensive project at over 6000 lines of code. It was written from scratch
in order to learn the Python programming language and fulfill my fantasies about the
perfect video game.

At it's current stage in development (v0.1), the program supports one person two-handed or two-person
hotseat play. To play Shamdalar, python old/magic_script.py in the command line. v0.1
is intended as a test of concept of the game engine, with full 
implementation of application design in the MVC paradigm as a next step.

Known issues: 
-Incomplete rules support for copy effects outside the scope of the ISD card
file. 

Magic: the Gathering, all card names, oracle text, and the Magic: the Gathering 
Comprehensive Rules document are the sole properties of Wizards of the Coast.
